# Optional OpenID header tag stuff

# You would get these URLs from your OpenID provider's help pages; look for a

# code.  Then take the URLs from that code and paste them into the respective
# keys here.
# 
# You can omit either provider and local_id or server and delegate if your
# provider does not give you those URLs.  However, server and provider are
# often the same, as are delegate and local_id.

# Themes
# Templum syntax is accepted here.
#
# You can also set an optional "custom_css" key for each theme, which, as
# its name suggests, lets you add custom CSS to that theme.  The CSS will
# be added to the end of the original stylesheet.  Templum is accepted in
# custom CSS, and you also have access to a $theme array, which contains
# all of the other settings for the theme.
